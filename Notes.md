Fistly, I created basicly html layout with emmit. (! + TAB)

Then i started work on the videos section in HTML.

I added div's, sections, articles, a tags, img's and some basic info for a video.

I used CSS grid to make an grid system similar to youTubes grids. 

I have already created the basic template for 1 youtube video, i copy and past that 6 times in its respective container. 

I then copy and paste the container holding 6 video sections 2 times giving me a total of 18 vieos and 3 video cointainers.

The first container does not have a border at its top and the middle cointainer is a special section. 

I Then create the navbar 
and I style it.
